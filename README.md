# Emotion-Recognition-Model

Building an emotion recognition model from facial expressions involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview of the process, followed by a detailed example using TensorFlow and Keras.

High-Level Overview
Data Collection: Gather a dataset of facial expressions labeled with emotions.
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the images (e.g., resizing, normalization).
Model Building: Create a deep learning model (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network).
Model Training: Train the model on the dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a test set.
Inference: Use the trained model to predict emotions from new images or videos.
